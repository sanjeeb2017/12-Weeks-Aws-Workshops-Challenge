# WEEK -1 : Foundation - AWS Core Services

Welcome to AWS Workshop challenge - Week1. For each week challenge, we will put details on the challenge overview, problem statement / solution approach  and conclusion/learning from the challenge.

**Challenge Overview:**

In this challenge, we will learn the foundation or imporant services of AWS. However before deep dive into AWS services, we will first understand below fundamental concepts.

1. Overview of Cloud Computing and deployment types.
2. Benifits of Cloud Computing.
3. What is AWS Cloud and its eco system.
4. Fundemnatal /Core services of AWS.

**Problem Statement:**

For any new person who is interested to start the cloud journey, it is very important to know basic details on the cloud computing and different cloud service providers in the current market. In this workshop challenge, the main focus is AWS, so it is very important to understand what is AWS and core services of AWS.

**Solution:**

Let's start the discussion.

**`1.What is Cloud Computing:`**

**Cloud Computing** is on demand delivery of computing services such as compute, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet so called cloud.It helped organization to provision the infrastructure in quick time compare to traditional approach where it took months to build the infrastructure. It eliminates the need for enterprises to procure, configure, or manage resources themselves, and they only pay for what they use and zero or less administration on the infrastructure.

There are three types of cloud computing service models.
1. IaaS ( Infrastrure as a Service): It offers compute and storage services.
2. PaaS ( Platform as a Service) : It offers a develop-and-deploy environment to build cloud apps.
3. SaaS ( Software as a Service) : It delivers apps as services.

There are 3 different **cloud computing deployment** models available i.e public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud. 

**`Public Cloud:`**

Public clouds are run by third-party cloud service providers. They offer compute, storage, and network resources over the internet, enabling companies to access shared on-demand resources based on their unique requirements and business goals. The main 3 public cloud providers are AWS, Google, GCP

**`Private Cloud:`**

Private clouds are built, managed, and owned by a single organization and privately hosted in their own data centers, commonly known as “on-premises” or “on-prem.” They provide greater control, security, and management of data while still enabling internal users to benefit from a shared pool of compute, storage, and network resources.

**`Hybrid Cloud:`**

Hybrid clouds combine public and private cloud models, allowing companies to leverage public cloud services and maintain the security and compliance  capabilities commonly found in private cloud architectures.

**`2.Benifits of Cloud Computing`**

1. Flexible and easy to use. User can access the environment any where from the world, just need the internet access.
2. Pay as you go model. Pay what you have used. It is very cost effective. User can always spin up server with couple of clicks and start the developement of business usecase and start seeing the values quickly.
3. Secure, cloud service providers are align with most of the compliance requirements, by saying that security is a shared responsibilty. 

cloud has many advantage but we just listed some of them above.

**`3.What is AWS cloud:`**

AWS stands for Amazon Web Service. AWS is the top public cloud service provider.Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers—including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies—are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster.

Before we will understand the core services of AWS, couple of pre-requisites we have to complete.

_**1. Create an AWS account**_

 To explore AWS world, it is very important to create an AWS account. We are not going to cover how to create an AWS account as the process is very simple. To get the step by step proces, please have a look on the youtube video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhW17g73fvY.

_**2. Create an IAM user**_
